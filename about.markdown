Hi I'm Colin, a numbers guy who seeks to better understand the world through data. Recent graduate of Cal Poly SLO's Statistics program, currently living in the California Bay Area.

Interested in basketball, chess, skateboarding, hip hop, pc games, good food, and fitness. Enjoys efficiency. Also into learning new languages and technologies and exploring them through coding projects.

I'm early in my career but I've got big plans. Seeking to be inspired and to work hard for things that are worth it, around people that bring out the best in me.

Please take a look at my stats resume, programming resume, or check out some examples of my work.
