<h3> Frogs and Robots</h3>

<p> This project was the culmination of my Project Based Object Oriented Programming course, where we took a raw script of 1000+ lines which defined a 'simulation' of several different object types and actors on a 2d map. Throughout the course we refactored and redesigned the project, changing its structure, its pathfinding, and eventually modifying the behavior and adding our own objects to turn it into our own game. I'll build a demo soon but for now you can view the source code and download it to build/play youself! </p>
