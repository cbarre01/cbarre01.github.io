<h3> K-Clique Finder</h3>

<p> A small class project which solves the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem'> clique problem </a>, a computational problem 'of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, also called complete subgraphs) in a graph'. This python script defines a map and vertex class, and takes an input graph and k value then returns the cliques within the graph. It exists as a python script for now but I'll make a demo of it soon! </p>
