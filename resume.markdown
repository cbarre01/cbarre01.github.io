    Analysis, Imputation.

-   Data management/cleaning - experienced in scraping, cleaning and
    converting raw data sources into analysis friendly formats using R,
    Python.

-   Effective collaborator on larger projects, ie. took classes on

CS Coursework
-------------

-   Completed a significant portion of the Cal Poly Computer Science
    program.

-   Courses taken include Object Oriented Programming (including
    refactoring a project of several thousand lines of code), Data
    Structures, Algorithms (including extensive study of classic
    algorithms and complexity theory), and many more.

    git version control and writing commented, modular code. Adept at
    building programs incrementally, writing unit tests, and breaking
    down/understanding large code bases.

Projects
========

2019-2020 - MLB Prediction Project
----------------------------------

-   Designed and developed an application which uses a simple
    feedforward neural network to generate predictions for the results
    of live MLB games.

-   Appropriated training data from many locations and formats including
    scraped web page HTML, APIs, and databases.

-   Compiled data to train neural network (written in python), then fed
    game data from ongoing games in order tocalculate predicted win
    share, which is displayed on a web page.

2019 - McCarthy Steel Mill Project
----------------------------------

-   Created surface composite design applied by steel mill to test new
    carbon steel coils. Personally presented design to client and
    instructed client on applying it.

-   Succeeded in finding multiple ideal temperature/hardness
    combinations which were utilized by the mill in future product runs.

2019 - Wildfire Project
-----------------------

-   Solo consultant on long term term grad thesis project analyzing fire
    damage from 2018 California wildfires (using data from GIS).

-   Designed data collection plan, assisted in applying and recording
    data, and after complete analysis using logistic regression was able
    to identifying factors (such as fence type) that might be associated
    with higher fire risk.

-   Results will be used by ranking county fire officials to help
    prepare for future fires. This study will also be the focus of this
    student’s grad thesis.

Experience
==========

2019 - Consultant for Cal Poly’s Statistical Consulting Service
---------------------------------------------------------------

-   Led several teams of 3-4 Statistics students consulting for local
    businesses and academics on several short term, tight deadline (1-2
    week) consulting projects, some of which are detailed above.

-   Created data collection plans, performed data cleaning, designed
    experiments, conducted technical analysis, interpreted and
    ‘translated’ analysis, produced visuals, wrote summary memos, and
    generally provided any guidance that might help improve projects.
