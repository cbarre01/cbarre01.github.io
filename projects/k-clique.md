<p> This was a small class project which solves the clique problem, a computational problem of finding cliques, or complete subgraphs, within a larger graph. It defines a map and vertex class, and takes an input graph and k value then returns the cliques within the graph. It exists as a python script for now but I'll make a demo of it soon! </p>
