					<h3>MLB Predictions</h3>
				</header>
				<p>My senior project in which I developed a simple feedforward neural network to predict the final results of live MLB games. The neural network model is trained in advance, using historical data collected and aggregated from multiple sources. This model is saved and used in a program which scrapes live game data (scores, pitchers, inning, and more) every 5 minutes and feeds it into the model to generate 'live' predictions.</p>

					<h3>HLTV Predictions</h3>
				</header>
				<p> Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a pc game which has worldwide popularity as an 'e-sport', meaning there are professionals from many countries who compete at the game as a full time job. In e-sports, just like in regular sports, there are massive amounts of data that can be analyzed to better understand the game and what elements make a successful player or team. This project, which is an extension of my senior project, is my attempt to harness that data and apply it in an approach similar to typical sports science. </p>

					<h3>California Wildfire Project</h3>
				</header>
				<p> In 2018 the Sonoma county in Central California was hit by a series of wildfires which destroyed hundreds of homes and displaced thousands of people. During my time at the Cal Poly Statistical Consulting Service I was fortunate enough to work one on one with Rudy Uribe, a county firefighter, on his graduate thesis on these 2018 wildfires. We investigated housing factors (eg. construction materials, design, nearby terrain) which may have put homes at greater or less risk of being destroyed. </p>

					<h3>McCarthy Steel Mill Project</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Another project I worked on for Cal Poly Stats Consulting, in which a team of students and I helped Dr. Tom Bensky of Cal Poly develop and analyze an experiment to determine an ideal temperature and strain combination for manufacturing strong carbon steel coils. My team designed a surface composite design which Dr. Bensky was able to carry out, and with the results were able to recommend several ideal parameter combinations for future investigation.</p>
